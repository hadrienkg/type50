# type50

Hello, welcome to **type50**!
This is just a simple typing test website, where you can procrastinate-I mean, test out your typing skills in a fun manner, through typing up random quotes! (Although, you may find that after typing in your first finished quote, a surprise lays ahead...)

Then, you can then open this project folder in an IDE, code editor, etc., like VSCode. Then, the terminal, you may need to run "npm install".

## How to use this project

After loading up the project on your browser, you should be able to see a website with a text/typing area, along with some typing stats and a restart button. Now, you can immediately just start typing away. You will see that as you type, the characters will become filled in, but if you make a mistake, they will turn red (even the spaces!). Also, note that you can backspace if you so desire (although you cannot revert your accuracy through this manner). If you so happen to click away from the text area (and it was not on the restart button), your cursor will disappear and you are unable to type anything in. However, your stats are paused, so if you wanted to take a break mid-quote, this is the way to go.
If you ever want to get a new quote, you can press the restart button, whether you are finished with the current quote or not. Also, you can press the "Tab" key mid-quote to restart, or you can press the "Enter" key post-quote to restart (tip: if one doesn't work, try the other). Lastly, you could also just refresh the page to get a new quote.

## The "story" mode

You will find that after typing in your first quote and restarting, a short "story" will unfold. Keep going with typing in these "story quotes", and you will soon reach the end of this "story" and it will revert back to generating random quotes (note that you cannot restart or go back to random quotes until you have progressed through the entire "story"). Also, if you have completed the "story" progression, you can simply close and reopen the tab ("http://localhost:3000") to be able to progress through the story again if desired.

**Happy typing!**
